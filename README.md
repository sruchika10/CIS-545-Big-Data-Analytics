# CIS-545-Big-Data-Analytics



This repository showcases my contributions and tasks undertaken during my Big Data Analytics course. It illustrates my proficiency in handling large-scale data, employing scalable computational models, and applying advanced techniques for data acquisition, wrangling, and integration. From the basics of big data to the intricacies of cloud computing and graph theory, I've gained practical experience and honed my skills across a wide range of data analytics subjects. The content ranges from web scraping, data transformation, text processing, to cloud and cluster data processing, providing a comprehensive look into my hands-on training in the field.


**Course Description:**
In the era of big data, we are increasingly faced with the challenges of converting massive amounts of data to actionable knowledge. Given the limits of individual machines (compute power, memory, bandwidth), increasingly the solution is to clean, integrate, and process the data using statistical machine learning techniques, in parallel on many machines. This course focuses on the fundamentals of scaling computation to handle common data analytics tasks. You will learn about basic tasks in collecting, wrangling, and structuring data; programming models for performing certain kinds of computation in a scalable way across many compute nodes; common approaches to converting algorithms to such programming models; standard toolkits for data analysis consisting of a wide variety of primitives; and popular distributed frameworks for analytics tasks such as filtering, graph analysis, clustering, and classification.

**Software:** Python, SQL, AWS, Apache Spark, MapReduce
